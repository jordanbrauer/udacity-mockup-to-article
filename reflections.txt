You've learned a lot about web development so far. I want you to take a moment to write down your thoughts about web development here. Answer the following questions:
  * What new skills have you learned?
  * What has been easy?
  * What has been difficult?
  * How have you used the problem solving strategies from the first project to overcome challenges so far?

Not a whole lot to be honest. I am pretty fluent with HTML, and am taking this nano degree to brush up on my skills before moving to a back-end focus. Everything has been pretty easy so far, thus nothing has been difficult! :) I haven't had to employee many problem solving strategies so far, but I guess I would say a strategy would be using the MDN, I forgot the tag to create crossed out text in HTML and checked their HTML documentation quickly.
